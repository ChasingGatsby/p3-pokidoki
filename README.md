## Usage 
Once you've created an account, you can search for users based on certain parameters. At the moment, you can only search by species of Pokemon and types (more planned in the future!).  
You can then click on any retrieved profiles and view their account information and send them a match request. Once that match request has been received, you can now message and receive messages from that user.  
You can also edit your current profile to change your displayed information.There is also an option to change the color theme of the website within the Settings tab.
